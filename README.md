#Some batch file for boost my workflow#

##Android Emulator Picker##

>Run Android Emulator when I don't fell like to open Android Studio... Which is EVERYTIME! I use VS Emulator at home, so this will only be effect in office I guess.

* Android Emulator needed
* Do remember to change the path and the sdk name if needed
* You know the drill
* Because you are the only one who use this stuff
* Don't be stupid

##RN-Builder##

>Writting React is some kind of fun, but all the process to generate an apk is a pain in my ass... use this to simply do all the command thingy for my lazyness.
---
* Gardle is necessary
* Gradle is terrible
* JAVA? Of course.
* Only use it on the project generated by "react-native init"
* Same, change the path and name if needed.
* This is not perfect, mind some bug in it.
* I'm not gonna fix the bug, because I'm a totally noob in batch
* Whatever
